This example was written in Java with lwjgl. It is based on the PBR (physically
based rendering) tutorial from [learnopengl.com](https://www.learnopengl.com/).
The material used is from [freepbr.com](https://www.freepbr.com/).

## Building
The project uses [gradle](https://gradle.org/) for building. Clone the project
and run `./gradlew distZip`. This will create a zip file with all the files
needed to run it (resources and libraries). The zip file can be found in
`build/distributions`.
