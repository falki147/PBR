This example was written in Java with lwjgl. It is based on the PBR (physically
based rendering) tutorial from [learnopengl.com](https://www.learnopengl.com/).
The material used is from [freepbr.com](https://www.freepbr.com/) It can be
built using gradle. Using the `distZip` task the project can be combined into a
single .zip file.
